# Susheel Srikanth – Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The site presents a curated overview of my academic background, technical skills, and professional projects in data science and analytics.

## About Me

I’m a graduate student in Data Science at Vanderbilt University, with a foundation in engineering and a strong focus on applied analytics, machine learning, and AI-driven solutions.

My work spans NLP, cloud computing, predictive modeling, and data infrastructure — with hands-on experience using tools like Python, AWS, SQL, and PySpark to solve real-world problems. I've collaborated on projects ranging from customer simulation systems and job-matching platforms to quantum simulations and public policy research.

I'm especially interested in roles and collaborations that involve data strategy, model development, and scalable analytics in domains like tech, automotive, consulting, and fintech.
